# COBRA-MATCOM
The COBRA/MATCOM is a companion code suite for COBRA-EN developed by the author for the purpose of this assignment. It has an MIT open source license and the source code is currently hosted in a GitHub repository under the same name. The source code is written in MATLAB and integrates seamlessly with COBRA-EN. The kernel can generate COBRA-EN input files on the go and executes COBRA against it and finally captures the output. The cobra_in_handle.m generates COBRA-EN specific input fields following the conventional rules. The cobra_out_handle.m code from the COBRA/MATCOM handles the output from COBRA by extracting desired data, uses local linear approximation to map values between different set of independent points as well as finds interpolated minimum or maximum from datapoints by polynomial fitting. It is also responsible for plotting and outputting image files of the plot. At the time of writing, the code is under revision for an object-oriented overhaul along with core fixes and improved capability. A GUI is also under development.
